== Headless flash proxies with node.js

Traditionally, flash proxies have run in the browser. However, it may be
desirable to run them as background daemons. This directory contains a main.js
file which wraps the regular flashproxy.js and runs headlessly from node.js.

To install the requirements (known to be in Debian testing and Ubuntu universe),

    > apt-get install git nodejs npm

Then, if you've checked out the flashproxy source from git,

    > git clone https://git.torproject.org/flashproxy.git
    > cd flashproxy/modules/nodejs
    > npm install
    > npm start  # or, node main.js

This package is also being published on the npm registry. To add a `flashproxy`
bin to your path without checking out from git, at any time run,

    > npm install -g flashproxy
    > flashproxy

Rather than install globally, you can also,

    > cd ~/  # or, to the dir of your choice
    > npm install flashproxy
    > npm start flashproxy  # or, node node_modules/flashproxy
