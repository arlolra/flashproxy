FLASHPROXY-REG-APPSPOT(1)
=========================

NAME
----
flashproxy-reg-appspot - Register with a facilitator through Google App Engine.

SYNOPSIS
--------
**flashproxy-reg-appspot** [__OPTIONS__] [__REMOTE__][:__PORT__]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Register with a flash proxy facilitator through a Google App Engine app.
By default the remote address registered is ":9000" (the
external IP address is guessed). It requires https://www.google.com/ not
to be blocked.

This program uses a trick to talk to App Engine, even though appspot.com
may be blocked. The IP address and Server Name Indication of the request
are for www.google.com, but the Host header inside the request is for an
appspot.com subdomain.

Requires the **flashproxy-reg-url** program.

    Name lookups use only IPv4.

**-6**::
    Name lookups use only IPv6.
