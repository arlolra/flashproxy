FLASHPROXY-REG-EMAIL(1)
=======================

NAME
----
flashproxy-reg-email - Register with a facilitator using the email method

SYNOPSIS
--------
**flashproxy-reg-email** [__OPTIONS__] [__REMOTE__][:__PORT__]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Register with a flash proxy facilitator through email. Makes a STARTTLS
connection to an SMTP server and sends mail with a client IP address to a
designated address. By default the remote address registered is
":9000" (the external IP address is guessed based on the SMTP server's
response).

Using an SMTP server or email address other than the defaults will not work
unless you have made special arrangements to connect them to a facilitator.

The email address is not polled continually. After running the program,
it may take up to a minute for the registration to be recognized.

This program requires the M2Crypto library for Python.
