Title: WebSocket pluggable transport
Author: David Fifield

Overview

  This proposal describes the "websocket" pluggable transport for Tor.
  It uses the WebSocket protocol now implemented by many web browsers.
  It is mostly a straightforward description of proxying WebSocket to
  plain TCP, with special consideration for a base64 encoding for agents
  that don't support binary WebSocket frames.

Motivation

  The WebSocket protocol is used by the "flash proxy" system that uses
  web browsers as temporary proxies; browsers may connect to a relay
  that supports this pluggable transport. Additionally, if WebSocket has
  a lot of non-Tor use, it becomes a good target for tunneling, perhaps
  in conjunction with a lower layer of obfuscation. WebSocket commonly
  works over HTTP ports that are likely to get through a firewall.

WebSocket overview

  WebSocket is a protocol (rather, several mostly compatible protocols)
  aimed at exposing socket-like functionality to JavaScript in web
  browsers. It is partially aimed at supplanting techniques such as HTTP
  long polling for client–server communication. WebSocket provides
  bidirectional communication between a client and server, sufficient to
  tunnel Tor traffic. A WebSocket session begins with an HTTP Upgrade
  handshake. The socket carries data broken into variable-length
  "messages" which are further broken into "frames." There are
  distinguished frame opcodes that serve to send either data or control
  information. Frames sent by the client (but not the server) are XORed
  with a repeating 32-bit mask that is randomly generated per-frame.

  Broadly speaking, there are two versions of WebSocket: the older
  "hixie" protocol, and the newer "hybi" protocol which is now RFC 6455.
  There are subprotocols within these two versions that differ only in
  small ways: "hixie-75" and "hixie-76"; and "hybi-7", "hybi-10", and
  "hybi-17". The older "hybi" sockets were supported by Firefox 4 and
  Opera 11, but were later disabled because of problems with interaction
  with reverse HTTP proxies. Current versions of Firefox and Chrome
  support "hybi" sockets, while Safari only supports "hixie".

  The "hybi" sockets support text frames and binary frames. Text frames
  may only include UTF-8–encoded text; it is an error if payload doesn't
  decode. Binary frames may contain any binary data. However, not all
  web browsers support binary frames; they were first added to Firefox
  in version 11. The "hixie" sockets have only text frames.

Method name

  The method name of the transport is "websocket". For example, these
  are possible torrc configurations for a client and server,
  respectively:

UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin websocket exec /usr/libexec/tor-websocket-proxy --client
Bridge websocket 198.51.100.1

ServerTransportPlugin websocket exec /usr/libexec/tor-websocket-proxy --server

The base64 subprotocol

  The most convenient way to tunnel data over WebSocket is with binary
  frames, but not all web browsers support binary frames. To work around
  this, the "base64" subprotocol encodes binary data as base64 within
  text frames. A client that knows it does not support binary frames
  requests the base64 subprotocol by including "base64" in the value of
  the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header field. A server that also supports
  this subprotocol by sending the value "base64" (and only "base64") in
  the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header field of its response. See under
  "Examples" for examples of handshakes like this.

  The base64 encoding is applied at the message level, not the frame
  level. This means, in particular, that any '=' padding occurs only at
  the end of a message, not at the end of each of its constituent
  frames. So, for example, the 5-byte message "Hello", whose base64
  encoding is "SGVsbG8=", may be sent as one text frame as follows:

    0x81 0x08 "SGVsbG8="

  or, for example, as two frames (one of 2 bytes and one of 6 bytes):

    0x01 0x02 "SG" 0x81 0x06 "VsbG8="

  When sent by a client, all frames including these must be masked. Here
  is an example of a masked base64-encoded message sent as a single
  frame (using the masking key 0x12345678):

    0x81 0x18 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 0x41 0x73 0x00 0x0b 0x70 0x73 0x6e 0x45

Examples

  Here are examples of WebSocket handshakes and the beginning of data
  transfer. The data is the beginning of a Tor connection (i.e., it
  begins with a TLS handshake). Data are shown using C string syntax.
  "> " at the beginning of a line indicates client-to-server
  communication; "< " is server-to-client. "[...]" indicates contents
  omitted for brevity. Newlines in the presentation are not significant.
  This section is non-normative.

Considerations specific to pluggable transports

  Endpoints must implement WebSocket according to RFC 6455; for example,
  a server MUST close the connection if it receives an unmasked frame
  from a client, and a client MUST close the connection if it receives a
  masked frame from a server (RFC 6455 section 5.1). There are also
  additional requirements for WebSocket when used as a Tor pluggable
  transport.

  Clients MUST implement the RFC 6455 version of the protocol and use it
  for all connections. Servers MUST implement the RFC 6455 version of
  the protocol and MAY also implement earlier versions. That is, a
  server MAY check a client HTTP request to see if it matches an earlier
  version of the protocol, and MAY begin communicating using that
  protocol. Section 4.4 of RFC 6455 discusses supporting multiple
  versions of the protocol.

  Servers MUST support binary frames (opcode 2). Servers MAY also
  support text frames (opcode 1). Servers supporting text frames MUST
  implement the base64 subprotocol and accept it when requested by a
  client in the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header field. Text frames MUST
  NOT be sent by either side if the base64 subprotocol has not been
  negotiated. Any endpoint receiving a text frame when base64 has not
  been negotiated, or a text message that cannot be decoded as base64,
  MUST close the connection.

  A client MUST NOT proceed after receiving any HTTP response status
  code other than 101. In particular, it MUST NOT follow redirections
  such as 301.

  Endpoints SHOULD respond to Ping frames with a single Pong frame, but
  nothing in this specification requires the sending of Ping frames.

  Message and frame boundaries are not meaningful. Received non-control
  messages are concatenated, in order, to reconstruct the original
  stream. Endpoints SHOULD limit the size of messages they send. All
  messages SHOULD be sent in a single frame.

  Endpoints MUST limit the size of messages and frames that they will
  buffer. When the sum of the length of already-buffered data and the
  length of the next frame exceeds the limit, the endpoint MUST close
  the connection and SHOULD do so with a status code of 1009 (see RFC
  6455 section 7.4.1). Endpoints MUST be capable of receiving messages
  containing up to 1500 octets of binary data; this may require
  buffering up to 2026 bytes of UTF-8–encoded base64 text.

Questions/extensions

  WebSocket also has a TLS-wrapped version, identified by using the
  "wss" (as opposed to "ws") URL scheme. An advantage of this when
  tunneling through a browser is that the TLS handshake will be exactly
  that of a browser. However, this probably requires the certificates of
  relays' server transport plugins to be trusted by browsers.
