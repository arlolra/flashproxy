This package contains files needed to run a flashproxy facilitator.
Normal users who just want to bypass censorship, should use the
flashproxy-client package instead.

For instructions on building/installing this package from source, see
INSTALL. (This should only be necessary if your distro does not already
integrate this package into its repositories.)

The flashproxy config directory is installation-dependant, usually at
/etc/flashproxy or /usr/local/etc/flashproxy. You are strongly
recommended to keep this on encrypted storage.

The main backends, facilitator and facilitator-reg-daemon, are installed
as system services, and you should be able to configure them in the
appropriate place for your system (e.g. /etc/default/facilitator for a
Debian-based system using initscripts).

At a minimum, each installation has its own public-private keypair at
reg-daemon.{pub,key} in the flashproxy config directory. You will need
to securely distribute the public part (.pub) to your users - e.g. by
publishing it somewhere, signed by your own PGP key.

There are three supported helper rendezvous methods: HTTP, email, and
appspot. Each helper method may require additional manual configuration
and might also depend on other helper methods; see the corresponding
doc/x-howto.txt for more details.

For suggestions on configuring a dedicated facilitator machine, see
doc/server-howto.txt.

For documentation on the design of the facilitator components, see
doc/facilitator-design.txt.
