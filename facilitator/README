This package contains files needed to run a flashproxy facilitator.
Normal users who just want to bypass censorship, should use the
flashproxy-client package instead.

For instructions on building/installing this package from source, see
INSTALL. (This should only be necessary if your distro does not already
integrate this package into its repositories.)

Each installation has its own public-private keypair, typically in
reg-daemon.{pub,key} in your flashproxy config directory. You will need
to securely distribute the public part (.pub) to your users - e.g. by
publishing it somewhere, signed by your own PGP key.

There are three supported helper rendezvous methods: HTTP, URL, and
email. Each helper method may require additional manual configuration;
see the corresponding doc/x-howto.txt for more details.

For suggestions on configuring a dedicated facilitator machine, see
doc/facilitator-howto.txt.

For documentation on the design of the facilitator components, see
doc/facilitator-design.txt.
