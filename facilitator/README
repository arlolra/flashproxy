This package contains files needed to run a flashproxy facilitator.
Normal users who just want to bypass censorship, should use the
flashproxy-client package instead.

For instructions on building/installing this package from source, see
INSTALL. (This should only be necessary if your distro does not already
integrate this package into its repositories.)

For instructions on setting up and running the facilitator, see
doc/facilitator-howto.txt.
