== Running from source checkout

In order to run the code directly from a source checkout, you must make sure it
can find the flashproxy module, located in the top-level directory of the
source checkout, which is probably the parent directory. You have two options:

1. Install it in "development mode", see [1]

  flashproxy# python setup-common.py develop

This process is reversible too:

  flashproxy# python setup-common.py develop --uninstall

The disadvantage is that other programs (such as a system-installed flashproxy,
or other checkouts in another directory) will see this development copy, rather
than a more appropriate copy.

2. Export PYTHONPATH when you need to run

  $ export PYTHONPATH=..
  $ make check

The disadvantage is that you need to do this every shell session.
