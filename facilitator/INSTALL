Install the dependencies.

	$ apt-get install make openssl python-m2crypto
	$ apt-get install gnulib # if running from git

Configure and install.

	$ ./autogen.sh # if running from git or ./configure doesn't otherwise exist
	$ ./configure --localstatedir=/var/local && make
	# make pre-install install post-install

This installs facilitator.cgi, facilitator, facilitator-email-poller,
facilitator-reg-daemon, facilitator-reg, and fac.py to /usr/local/bin.
It also installs System V init files to /etc/init.d/.

The pre/post-install scripts create a user for the daemon to as, and
sets up the initscripts in the default system runlevels.

They also generate a RSA key in /usr/local/etc/flashproxy/reg-daemon.{key,pub}.
You will have to edit flashproxy-reg-email (in the client package) and
copy the contents of reg-daemon.pub into the appropriate place.
TODO(infinity0): find a better solution for this.

You should also edit /usr/local/etc/flashproxy/reg-email.pass to contain your
app-specific Gmail password; see doc/gmail-setup.txt for instructions.

Uninstall.

	# make pre-remove uninstall post-remove
