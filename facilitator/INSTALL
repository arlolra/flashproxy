Install the dependencies.

	$ apt-get install make openssl python-m2crypto
	$ apt-get install gnulib # if running from git

Configure and install.

	$ ./autogen.sh # if running from git or ./configure doesn't otherwise exist
	$ ./configure --localstatedir=/var/local --enable-initscripts && make
	# make pre-install install post-install

This installs facilitator.cgi, facilitator, facilitator-email-poller,
facilitator-reg-daemon, facilitator-reg, and fac.py to /usr/local/bin.
It also installs System V init files to /etc/init.d/.

The pre/post-install scripts create a user for the daemon to as, and
sets up the initscripts in the default system runlevels.

They also generate a RSA key in /usr/local/etc/flashproxy/reg-daemon.{key,pub}.
You should securely distribute the public key to anyone that wants to
use your facilitator; they will need to pass it as the
--facilitator-pubkey option to flashproxy-reg-email.

You should also edit /usr/local/etc/default/facilitator-email-poller to
contain your Gmail address and /usr/local/etc/flashproxy/reg-email.pass
to contain your app-specific password; see doc/gmail-howto.txt for
instructions.

Uninstall.

	# make pre-remove uninstall post-remove
