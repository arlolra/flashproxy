These are instructions for how to set up a Google App Engine application
to run at appspot.com.

You first need to create a Google account. See gmail-howto.txt for how
to do that.

Download the SDK:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/devenvironment

Write your program and app.yaml file:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/helloworld

When you're ready to upload, log in with your Google account and follow
the directions:
https://appengine.google.com/
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/uploading

Enter an application ID and create the application.

Use the appcfg.py program to upload the program. It should look
something like this:

$ torify ./google_appengine/appcfg.py update myapp/
07:25 PM Host: appengine.google.com
07:25 PM Application: application-id; version: 1
07:25 PM
Starting update of app: application-id, version: 1
07:25 PM Getting current resource limits.

07:26 PM Scanning files on local disk.
07:26 PM Cloning 2 application files.
07:26 PM Uploading 1 files and blobs.
07:26 PM Uploaded 1 files and blobs
07:26 PM Compilation starting.
07:26 PM Compilation: 1 files left.
07:26 PM Compilation completed.
07:26 PM Starting deployment.
07:26 PM Checking if deployment succeeded.
07:26 PM Deployment successful.
07:26 PM Checking if updated app version is serving.
07:26 PM Completed update of app: application-id, version: 1

Uploading the program in this way seems to create the files
~/.appcfg_nag and ~/.appcfg_cookies. Running the update command again
doesn't require you to enter your password again.

Once logged in, you can disable logging for the application. Click
"Logs" on the left panel. Under "Total Logs Storage", click "Change
Settings". Enter "0" in the "days of logs" box and click "Save
Settings".
