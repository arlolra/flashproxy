These are instructions for how to set up a Google App Engine application
for the appspot rendezvous method (flashproxy-reg-appspot). It requires
the HTTP rendezvous to be available, so you should set that up first and
ensure it is working correctly, or find someone else's to use. If you
choose the latter, note that it is *their* reg-daemon.pub that your users
must give to flashproxy-reg-appspot.

You first need to create a Google account. See email-howto.txt for how
to do that.

Download the SDK:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/devenvironment

Find your facilitator appengine installation, probably in reg-appspot/
in your flashproxy config dir. Edit config.go to point to the address of
the HTTP facilitator.

Follow the directions to register a new application:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/uploading
Enter an application ID and create the application.

Use the appcfg.py program to upload the program. It should look
something like this:

$ torify ./google_appengine/appcfg.py -A <YOUR_APP_ID> update reg-appspot/
07:25 PM Host: appengine.google.com
07:25 PM Application: application-id; version: 1
07:25 PM
Starting update of app: application-id, version: 1
07:25 PM Getting current resource limits.

07:26 PM Checking if deployment succeeded.
07:26 PM Deployment successful.
07:26 PM Checking if updated app version is serving.
07:26 PM Completed update of app: application-id, version: 1

Uploading the program in this way seems to create the files
~/.appcfg_nag and ~/.appcfg_cookies. Running the update command again
doesn't require you to enter your password again.

Once logged in, you can disable logging for the application. Click
"Logs" on the left panel. Under "Total Logs Storage", click "Change
Settings". Enter "0" in the "days of logs" box and click "Save
Settings".
