These are instructions for how to set up an Apache Web Server for
handling the HTTP client registration method (fp-registrar.cgi /
flashproxy-reg-http / flashproxy-reg-url), as well as for browser
proxies to poll and receive a client to serve.

Unfortunately we only had time to give commands specific to the Debian
distribution of Apache; other distributions may need to tweak some
things, e.g. a2enmod, a2ensite only exist on Debian.

== HTTP server setup

Apache is the web server that runs the CGI program.

	# apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-evasive
	# a2enmod ssl headers

Edit /etc/apache2/ports.conf and comment out the port 80 configuration.

	# NameVirtualHost *:80
	# Listen 80

Copy examples/fp-facilitator.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-available/ or
wherever is appropriate for your Apache2 installation, then edit it as
per the instructions given in that file itself.

Link the configured site into sites-enabled.
	# a2ensite fp-facilitator.conf

=== HTTPS setup

The HTTP server should serve only over HTTPS and not unencrypted HTTP.
You will need a certificate and private key from a certificate
authority. An article on making a certificate signing request and
getting it signed is here:
	http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/284
This is the basic command to generate a CSR.
	$ openssl req -new -nodes -out fp-facilitator.csr.pem
The instructions below assume you have an offline private key
in fp-facilitator.key.pem and a certificate in fp-facilitator.crt.pem.

Make a file containing both the private key and a certificate.

	$ cat fp-facilitator.key.pem fp-facilitator.crt.pem > fp-facilitator.pem
	$ chmod 400 fp-facilitator.pem

Copy the new fp-facilitator.pem to the facilitator server as
/etc/apache2/fp-facilitator.pem.

	# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
