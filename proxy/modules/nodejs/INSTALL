First, install nodejs:

    # apt-get install nodejs

Make sure flashproxy.js exists in the current directory, either a symlink or
a plain copy.

== Install from source

If your distribution contains both the following packages (newer suites of
Debian and Ubuntu), you can run main.js directly:

    # apt-get install node-optimist node-xmlhttprequest node-ws
    $ nodejs main.js

Otherwise, you can use npm to install it as a package, along with all its
dependencies:

    # apt-get install npm
    # npm install -g
    $ flashproxy

== Install from npm registry

This package is also being published on the npm registry. To install from there
rather than your local copy, run:

    # npm install -g flashproxy
    $ flashproxy

Rather than install globally, you can also,

    $ cd ~/  # or, to the dir of your choice
    $ npm install flashproxy
    $ npm start flashproxy  # or, node node_modules/flashproxy
